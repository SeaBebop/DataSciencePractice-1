# DataSciencePractice-1
This is my first github so bare with me.

Anaconda-Jupyter Notebook is used. Summer Research studies based on berekley data on the weather. 
Goal is to understand how the code works and get the monthly average. 
Secondary goal is to experiment with the code to make alot of mistakes and learn from them. It is not about geting it right, it is about progress.
